	 * Autonomous Code Goals:
	 * 
	 * The code for autonomous should initialize all motors in the correct starting positions.
	 * Positional variables should be set for top position, bottom floor position, and a lower switch position.
	 * Each of these positions should be the correct values to have a block in various useful positions.
	 * Move up and down depending on if the robot has a block and if the robot is in the correct field position.
	 */
	
	/*
	 * Manual Control Goals:
	 * Some sort of slider/wheel control for the up and down motion of the lifter needs to input a value to move the lifter to.
	 * There should be a direct relationship between the input device's position and the lifter's position, as opposed to some sort
	 * of joystick input where the input is either a command to ascend or to descend.
	 * Possibly implement a button that slows the lifter to a different speed in case fine-tuning is needed in the lifter's position.
